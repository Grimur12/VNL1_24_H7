# Plan for the 3 week period

- Decided that we will show up to HR between 9 and 9:30, and leave around 3:30 at the latest. If there is additional work we will finish it through discord or individually.

- We have to know what each memeber is working on before going home so that everybody knows what to do and what our priorities are.

- We will split up into pairs when we start coding, two people for each layer. The pairs and which pair takes what layer will be decided in Week 2.

  - Pedro
  - Olafur

Today's work: 

- The main objectives of the day:
  - Get input on the refined model diagram and layered class diagram
    - Use that input to finalize the structure so that only some functionality needs to be added inside the logic classes
  - Start on the State Diagram, figure out how to structure it and decide what functionality we want to specify in that diagram
  - Finish the Use cases.
  - Finish the Functional Requirements.
  - Sketch up ideas on how we will display the UI.

- Issues: 
  - There was a bit of miscommunication regarding the use cases so there were duplicates and the wording was not cohesive, changes had to be made and the use cases are well on their way to be finished
  - Some time went into drawing up the State Diagram sketches in more detail than is wanted in the State Diagram, it became too cluttered so we had to restart the drawing and split them into seperate functionalities with only the core flow included.
