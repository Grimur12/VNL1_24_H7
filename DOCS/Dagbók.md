# Plan for the 3 week period

- Decided that we will show up to HR between 9 and 9:30, and leave around 3:30 at the latest. If there is additional work we will finish it through discord or individually.

- We have to know what each memeber is working on before going home so that everybody knows what to do and what our priorities are.

- We will split up into pairs when we start coding, two people for each layer. The pairs and which pair takes what layer will be decided in Week 2.

Today's work:

- The group went to Gylfi's lecture.

- Each member created a GitHub account or already had one and joined the VNL1 GitHub repo.

- Some time was spent reading about Git / GitHub and how to use it.

- We started with a rough outline of the GitHub repo / How it will be structured.
  
- We split into different groups focusing on different tasks.
  - The GitHub Manual
  - Class Diagram
  - Functional Requirements
  - User Group analysis

End-of-day Results:
  - We have a rough idea about the Class Diagram and how to structure it / the code
  - The GitHub Manual has been completed
  - The Functional Requirements list is almost completed
  - User Group Analysis is almost completed

- [ ] Finish the Class Diagram
- [ ] Finish the State Diagram 
- [ ] Finish the Use Cases
- [ ] Finish the UX Goals
- [ ] Wireframe sketch of the TUI
- [ ] Finish the Functional Requirements

- Once the list of objectives are completed the rest of the group will join in on the Class Diagram to give input
- Olafur: Worked on the Wireframe sketch today and made user stories for Employee, Travel Destination, Housing and 
maintenance reports from employee, contractor and supervisor.

- We got some input regarding the Class Diagram, the main objective and top priority of tomorrow is to split the diagrams into Model and the Layerd Class Diagram.

End-of-day Results:
  - The User Group Analysis has been completed
  - The Wireframe sketch of the TUI has been completed
  - The core structure of the class and model diagrams have been mostly completed, its lacking in functionality
  - Cardinalities and relationships in the Model Diagram are almost done
  - Layered Class Diagram is lacking in functionality but the flow has been established

## [27/11/2024 - Dagur 3]

Mættir / In attendance:
  - Grímur
  - Leonard
  - Máni
  - Iðunn
  - Pedro
  - Olafur

Today's work: 

- The main objectives of the day:
  - Get input on the refined model diagram and layered class diagram
    - Use that input to finalize the structure so that only some functionality needs to be added inside the logic classes
  - Start on the State Diagram, figure out how to structure it and decide what functionality we want to specify in that diagram
  - Finish the Use cases.
  - Finish the Functional Requirements.
  - Sketch up ideas on how we will display the UI.

- Issues: 
  - There was a bit of miscommunication regarding the use cases so there were duplicates and the wording was not cohesive, changes had to be made and the use cases are well on their way to be finished
  - Some time went into drawing up the State Diagram sketches in more detail than is wanted in the State Diagram, it became too cluttered so we had to restart the drawing and split them into seperate functionalities with only the core flow included.

End-of-day Results:
  - The Use Cases have been completed
  - The Functional Requirements have been completed
  - The State Diagram is well along its way to completion
  - We have outlined the functionality of the UI Layer (How information will be displayed and how we gather user input)
  - The Model Diagram is mostly complete, it just needs a final look to make sure all the variables are there and some changes need to be made with the methods.
  - The Layered Class Diagram has more functionality but we need to move some methods from the Model Diagram into the relevant logic classes of the Class Diagram.

TODO:
- [x] Finish the Github Manual
- [ ] Finish the Class Diagram
- [ ] Finish the State Diagram 
- [x] Finish the Use Cases
- [ ] Finish the UX Goals
- [x] Wireframe sketch of the TUI
- [x] Finish the Functional Requirements
- [x] Finish the User Group Analysis
- [ ] Put everything together into a single pdf file to submit

  - Finish the Class Model Diagram and get input on the final design from TA's
  - Get input on the Wirefram Happy Paths from TA's
  - Finish the UX Goals
  - Put the finalised UX Goals, Use Cases, FR, User Group Analysis, Wireframe Happy Path's and Diagrams into the report.

- Issues: 
  - The day went smoothly no real issues in design

End-of-day Results:
  - We got feedback from our TA's on our Diagrams and other designs
  - Finished the Model Diagram
  - Finished the Class Diagram, including parameters and return values.
    - Good to mention here that this may very well change during the coding process as we further define our system or see a more efficient way to implement changes
  - Finished the UX Goals
  - Put everything together in a document that is ready to be submitted on friday

- Tomorrow:
  - Show up tomorrow see if we can add any text or spot any inconsistencies
  - Define tasks for next weeks coding, split into pairs and assign layers to each pair
  - Develop some pseudocode or a rough draft of how we want to implement these functions defined in the Diagrams.

We started the day at 9:40 and split into 3 groups, working on different parts of the code.
The coding started with defining the Models that are needed to complete the rest of the code.

- Pairs and Layers EOD Results and work:
  - Ólafur and Leonard are taking the UI Layer
    - First we quickly mapped out what we what we want each input to do and what page it directs to.
    - Then we watched a video on discord that shows the TUI from the previous year.
    - From the video we got a general idea on how we want the TUI to look like.
    - In the UI layer we have the TUI for general employees and managers.
    - Leonard worked on making the TUI for general employees while Ólafur made the TUI for managers as well as refining Leonards work.
    - We ran into 1 proplem for the day when printing the ASCII art we ran into a problem with some pipes not lining up propperly.
  - Grímur and Máni are taking the Data Layer
    - We initialized the structure of the classes for each DataBase logic class and made dictionary functions for each model to then write to json files.
    - Mainly worked on Employee DB logic, we need to split that into the different parts of employees.
  - Pedro and Iðunn are taking the Logic Layer
