# Plan for the 3 week period

- Decided that we will show up to HR between 9 and 9:30, and leave around 3:30 at the latest. If there is additional work we will finish it through discord or individually.

- We have to know what each memeber is working on before going home so that everybody knows what to do and what our priorities are.

- We will split up into pairs when we start coding, two people for each layer. The pairs and which pair takes what layer will be decided in Week 2.

- Each member created a GitHub account or already had one and joined the VNL1 GitHub repo.
- Some time was spent reading about Git / GitHub and how to use it.
- We started with a rough outline of the GitHub repo / How it will be structured.
  
- We split into different groups focusing on different tasks.
  - The GitHub Manual           (Grímur focused on this)

End-of-day Results:
  - We have a rough idea about the Class Diagram and how to structure it / the code
  - The GitHub Manual has been completed
  - The Functional Requirements list is almost completed
  - User Group Analysis is almost completed
  - The only thing that was fully completed was the GitHub Manual

End-of-day Results:
  - The User Group Analysis has been completed
  - The Wireframe sketch of the TUI has been completed
  - The core structure of the class and model diagrams have been mostly completed, its lacking in functionality
  - Cardinalities and relationships in the Model Diagram are almost done
  - Layered Class Diagram is lacking in functionality but the flow has been established

  - Grímur
  - Leonard
  - Máni
  - Iðunn
  - Pedro
  - Olafur

Today's work: 

- The main objectives of the day:
  - Get input on the refined model diagram and layered class diagram
    - Use that input to finalize the structure so that only some functionality needs to be added inside the logic classes
  - Start on the State Diagram, figure out how to structure it and decide what functionality we want to specify in that diagram
  - Finish the Use cases.
  - Finish the Functional Requirements.
  - Sketch up ideas on how we will display the UI.

- Issues: 
  - There was a bit of miscommunication regarding the use cases so there were duplicates and the wording was not cohesive, changes had to be made and the use cases are well on their way to be finished
  - Some time went into drawing up the State Diagram sketches in more detail than is wanted in the State Diagram, it became too cluttered so we had to restart the drawing and split them into seperate functionalities with only the core flow included.

End-of-day Results:
  - The Use Cases have been completed
  - The Functional Requirements have been completed
  - The State Diagram is well along its way to completion
  - We have outlined the functionality of the UI Layer (How information will be displayed and how we gather user input)
  - The Model Diagram is mostly complete, it just needs a final look to make sure all the variables are there and some changes need to be made with the methods.
  - The Layered Class Diagram has more functionality but we need to move some methods from the Model Diagram into the relevant logic classes of the Class Diagram.

TODO:
- [x] Finish the Github Manual
- [ ] Finish the Class Diagram
- [ ] Finish the State Diagram 
- [x] Finish the Use Cases
- [ ] Finish the UX Goals
- [x] Wireframe sketch of the TUI

We started the day at 9:40 and split into 3 groups, working on different parts of the code.
The coding started with defining the Models that are needed to complete the rest of the code.

- Pairs and Layers EOD Results and work:
  - Ólafur and Leonard are taking the UI Layer
    - First we quickly mapped out what we what we want each input to do and what page it directs to.
    - Then we watched a video on discord that shows the TUI from the previous year.
    - From the video we got a general idea on how we want the TUI to look like.
    - In the UI layer we have the TUI for general employees and managers.
    - Leonard worked on making the TUI for general employees while Ólafur made the TUI for managers as well as refining Leonards work.
    - We ran into 1 proplem for the day when printing the ASCII art we ran into a problem with some pipes not lining up propperly.
  - Grímur and Máni are taking the Data Layer
    - We initialized the structure of the classes for each DataBase logic class and made dictionary functions for each model to then write to json files.
    - Mainly worked on Employee DB logic, we need to split that into the different parts of employees.
  - Pedro and Iðunn are taking the Logic Layer
    - we worked on our files, set it up right and disgussed with the others how our layers are going to match because we are the middle layer(logic layer)
      to have a better idea how this is going to look like.
    - we started with functions and we needed to get information about how to do this and the three layer process.

Some discussion about previous day and implementation of certain bits of code:
  - Discussion about how we would implement the UI layer print statements
  - Either multiple larger print statements or automation with parameters for each UI display and choice

  - Ólafur and Leonard are taking the UI Layer
    - One of the two was sick but did work from home, the UI layer's setup and organization was completed.

    - today we finished our Employees Logic Layer. It took some time to finish it and we needed some help to understand it much better.
    - We havent tested our connections but we will do that tomorrow. 
  - Grímur and Máni are taking the Data Layer
    - Data layer nearly finished where the wrapper is good and has been tested. 
    - After a discussion with the TA's we deleted all remove functions as they are difficult to implement fully and functionally.
    - We also realized we need to implement a two file read system so the user can retrieve a file, exit it and then retrive it
    - again without having a half written file from previous retrieve attempt.

Pairs and Layers EOD Results and Todays work:
- Ólafur and Leonard have the UI
    - one of the members was still sick so the process of UI was processing slower than the other parts
    - the work of today on the UI layer was doing the managerUI
- Iðunn and Pedro have the LL
    - today we were working on logic layer employee and we were focusing on the connections between
      the wrapper and our other classes. it took some time because we got some failures come up but in
      the end we were able to figure most of it out and we will continue tomorrow. Tomorrow we hope to
      continue and test if we can use the same code for properties for create, view and more things.
- Máni and Grímur have the DL
    - They have finished the DL and they started helping out in the Logic Layer with connection problems that they were having.

Issues:
  - The connections have been a struggle to make everything work, we need alot of testing done.
