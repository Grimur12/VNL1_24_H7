# Plan for the 3 week period

- Decided that we will show up to HR between 9 and 9:30, and leave around 3:30 at the latest. If there is additional work we will finish it through discord or individually.

- We have to know what each memeber is working on before going home so that everybody knows what to do and what our priorities are.

- We will split up into pairs when we start coding, two people for each layer. The pairs and which pair takes what layer will be decided in Week 2.

Today's work:

- The group went to Gylfi's lecture.
- Each member created a GitHub account or already had one and joined the VNL1 GitHub repo.
- Some time was spent reading about Git / GitHub and how to use it.
- We started with a rough outline of the GitHub repo / How it will be structured.
  
- We split into different groups focusing on different tasks.
  - The GitHub Manual           (Grímur focused on this)
  - Class Diagram               (Everyone focused on this together)
      - Model Diagram          
      - State Diagram           (Iðunn and Pedro focused on this)

End-of-day Results:
  - We have a rough idea about the Class Diagram and how to structure it / the code
  - The GitHub Manual has been completed
  - The Functional Requirements list is almost completed
  - User Group Analysis is almost completed
  - The only thing that was fully completed was the GitHub Manual

- Olafur: Worked on the Wireframe sketch today and made user stories for Employee, Travel Destination, Housing and 
maintenance reports from employee, contractor and supervisor.

- We got some input regarding the Class Diagram, the main objective and top priority of tomorrow is to split the diagrams into Model and the Layerd Class Diagram.

End-of-day Results:
  - The User Group Analysis has been completed
  - The Wireframe sketch of the TUI has been completed
  - The core structure of the class and model diagrams have been mostly completed, its lacking in functionality
  - Cardinalities and relationships in the Model Diagram are almost done
  - Layered Class Diagram is lacking in functionality but the flow has been established

  - Grímur
  - Leonard
  - Máni
  - Iðunn
  - Pedro
  - Olafur

Today's work: 

- The main objectives of the day:
  - Get input on the refined model diagram and layered class diagram
    - Use that input to finalize the structure so that only some functionality needs to be added inside the logic classes
  - Start on the State Diagram, figure out how to structure it and decide what functionality we want to specify in that diagram
  - Finish the Use cases.
  - Finish the Functional Requirements.
  - Sketch up ideas on how we will display the UI.

- Issues: 
  - There was a bit of miscommunication regarding the use cases so there were duplicates and the wording was not cohesive, changes had to be made and the use cases are well on their way to be finished
  - Some time went into drawing up the State Diagram sketches in more detail than is wanted in the State Diagram, it became too cluttered so we had to restart the drawing and split them into seperate functionalities with only the core flow included.

End-of-day Results:
  - The Use Cases have been completed
  - The Functional Requirements have been completed
  - The State Diagram is well along its way to completion
  - We have outlined the functionality of the UI Layer (How information will be displayed and how we gather user input)
  - The Model Diagram is mostly complete, it just needs a final look to make sure all the variables are there and some changes need to be made with the methods.
  - The Layered Class Diagram has more functionality but we need to move some methods from the Model Diagram into the relevant logic classes of the Class Diagram.

TODO:
- [x] Finish the Github Manual
- [ ] Finish the Class Diagram
- [ ] Finish the State Diagram 
- [x] Finish the Use Cases
- [ ] Finish the UX Goals

We started the day at 9:40 and split into 3 groups, working on different parts of the code.
The coding started with defining the Models that are needed to complete the rest of the code.

- Pairs and Layers EOD Results and work:
  - Ólafur and Leonard are taking the UI Layer
    - First we quickly mapped out what we what we want each input to do and what page it directs to.
    - Then we watched a video on Discord that shows the TUI from the previous year.
    - From the video we got a general idea on how we want the TUI to look like.
    - In the UI layer we have the TUI for general employees and managers.
    - Leonard worked on making the TUI for general employees while Ólafur made the TUI for managers as well as refining Leonards work.
    - We ran into 1 proplem for the day when printing the ASCII art we ran into a problem with some pipes not lining up properly.
  - Grímur and Máni are taking the Data Layer
    - We initialized the structure of the classes for each DataBase logic class and made dictionary functions for each model to then write into json files.
    - Mainly worked on Employee DB logic, we need to split that into the different parts of employees.
  - Pedro and Iðunn are taking the Logic Layer
    - we worked on our files, set it up right and discussed with the others how our layers are going to match because we are the middle layer (logic layer) to have a better idea how this is going to look like.
    - we started with functions and we needed to get information about how to do this and the three layer process.

  - Grímur and Máni are taking the Data Layer
    - Data layer nearly finished where the wrapper is good and has been tested. 
    - After a discussion with the TA's we deleted all remove functions as they are difficult to implement fully and functionally.

      continue and test if we can use the same code for properties for create, view and more things.
- Máni and Grímur have the DL
    - They have finished the DL and they started helping out in the Logic Layer with connection problems that they were having.

    - Today this group needs to get the UI layer going.
  - Iðunn and Pedro
    - Today we want to finish the Maintenance Layer.
  - Grímur and Máni
    - Today we helped other group members with the Logic and UI layer and worked on the journal and what to change in the Design Report.
    - Over the weekend
      - Completed most of the Employee Logic
      - Completed most of the Property logic
      - Started on the Maintenance logic but need to gather more information on what exactly the system should be able to do with that 
    
The goal of today is to:
  - finish the Logic Layer
  - Get the UI layer almost finished or to finished position
  - We need to focus on connecting the branches and comment on our code.

Issues:
  - There was an issue with the Maintenance Logic, the model classes were wrong so we had to add a maintenance report model class
  - Change the maintenance logic completely on how to create, edit, close etc...
  - We also have not tied anything together with a Destination so we need to add a Destination DB and artifically populate it
  - And make sure our system takes the destination into consideration, with getting data and such 

Work done:
  - our code is currently running but we want to make the program look nicer on the UI part, so we will be working on that
  - we will see how pretty table works and maybe we will use that
  - Maintenance logic has been done

Today we hope to work on the to do list of week 3, we need to upgrade our designs and finish the code completely


Pairs and Layers EOD Results and Todays work:
Ólafur and Leonard
  - Group worked together in changing the look of the UI (displays)
  - Updated the Use cases and functional requirements, some of them were not correct initially and did not fit the desired system
  - In charge of testing the entire system looking for bugs, errors in input, any crashes and noting it down to be fixed
    
Iðunn and Pedro
  - The entire group worked together in changing the look of the UI (displays)
  - Added prettytables
  - Fixed the Model Class diagram to match it with the code models
  - Fixed the state diagram after the TA's opinion

Grímur and Máni
  - Worked on fixing the Layered Class Diagram so that
  - Finished Destination filtering, the group worked together in changing the UI look (displays)
  - Fixed minor bugs in the program, with users not being able to go back on certain inputs.
  - Fixing other minor bugs found when testing the functional requirements

Issues:
  - The UI is not fully completed looks wise but it is fully functional
  - We are using While True loops and exit statements, TA's recommended not doing that so we have to change how the UI runs
  - From while true loops into some break/quit mechanics via returning "b" or "q" if user inputs, therefore qutting or going back
