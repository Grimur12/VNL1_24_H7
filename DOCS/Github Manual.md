2) After that, you’ll go to a new page where you confirm your email and create a password.
3) Then, you’ll receive an email from GitHub with a launch code. Open GitHub using the green button in the email and enter the code to verify your account.
4) Once that’s done, you’ll have a GitHub account and can start creating and accessing "Repositories."

- Additional setup information

1) To create a "Repository," often just called a "Repo,"
2) There is a dropdown menu on the left side of the screen in your GitHub area where you can click the green button that says "New."
3) There, you name the Repo and choose whether you want to include a .gitignore, README, and other options.
4) To add collaborators to the Repo, start by going to the homepage of the Repo by clicking on it.
5) Then go to "Settings" at the top, under the name of the Repo.
6) In the "Settings" tab of the Repo, at the top under "Access," there is a section called "Collaborators," which you click.
7) On the screen, under "Manage Access," there is a green button that says "Add People." Click it and type the GitHub username of the person you want to invite to the Repo.
8) That person will then receive an email in the inbox linked to their GitHub account where they can accept the invitation.

## "Cloning", "Commits", "Push", "Pull"

- The following assumes that you have already downloaded and setup Github Deskop on your Local computer that you will be working on.

- Cloning
  1) Once you have either created or joined a GitHub repo you will need to clone it to you local computer to share code/documentation with your group members.
  2) To Clone the GitHub repo onto your local computer, the simplest way using GitHub Desktop is to open GitHub Desktop, then open the main repo screen, which is under the "<> Code" in the top right side of the screen under the repo's name.
  3) On that screen you will see the branch you are looking at, the documents in that branch and then a large green button called "<> Code".
  4) Press that button and a dropdown will appear, the default screen is under "HTTPS" and from there you will press the button in the middle called "Open with GitHub Desktop".
  5) This will prompt you to clone that repository in the GitHub Desktop application, after you accept cloning you can share files.

- Pulling
  1) Assuming you have already cloned the repository, you now are able to pull new files that have been pushed to the GitHub repo onto your local computer for you to work on in your own IDE.
  2) Before you start implementing something, it is recommended that you check if there are any new commits to the GitHub repository to avoid conflicts later down the line.
  3) To pull changes in GitHub Desktop, you first check your "Current Repository" and make sure that its the correct one, then you check if your "Current Branch" is the correct one.
  4) After verifying the repo and branch you then press "Fetch Origin" and you can see the changes that have been made, after that you press the blue button on the top right of the screen called "Pull Origin"
  5) This will sync your local copy with the latest changes from the GitHub repo.

- Commits
  1) After making changes to files in your local copy of the repository, you will need to commit those changes in GitHub Desktop.
  2) To commit, open GitHub Desktop, and select the repository and branch where your changes are made.
  3) In the "Changes" tab, you will see a list of modified files. Add a commit message describing what changes you made in the box on the bottom left, you need a summary and then an optional more detailed description.
  4) Once you've written your message, click the "Commit to main" button (or the appropriate branch name) to save those changes locally.
  5) This saves your work on your computer but doesn't share it with others in the repo yet

- Pushing
  1) After committing your changes locally, you will need to push them to the GitHub repository so that your group members can see them.
  2) To push your changes, go to GitHub Desktop, and with the correct repository and branch selected, click the blue "Push Origin" in the top right of the screen.
  3) This uploads your local commits to the GitHub server, making them available to others working on the same repository.
  4) Now your changes are live on GitHub, and others can pull them to update their own local copies.
